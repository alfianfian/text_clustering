Frames aggregated at the AMSDU level use\na common CRC check to enforce integrity. For longer aggregated AMSDU frames,\nthe packet error rate increases significantly for the same bit error rate.\nHence, multiple studies have proposed doing AMSDU aggregation adaptively based\non the error rate. This study evaluates if there is a \\emph{practical}\nadvantage in doing adaptive AMSDU aggregation based on the link bit error rate.\nEvaluations on a model show that instead of implementing a complex adaptive\nAMSDU frame aggregation mechanism which impact queuing and other implementation\naspects, it is easier to influence packet error rate with traditional\nmechanisms while keeping the AMSDU aggregation logic simple.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 1 |\n| 5 | 20977 | Witness-Functions versus Interpretation-Functions for Secrecy in Cryptographic Protocols: What to Choose?   Proving that a cryptographic protocol is correct for secrecy is a hard task.\nOne of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is\nincreasing, which means that the security level of every single atomic message\nexchanged in the protocol, safely evaluated, never deceases. Recently, two\nfamilies of functions have been proposed to measure the security level of\natomic messages. The first one is the family of interpretation-functions. The\nsecond is the family of witness-functions. In this paper, we show that the\nwitness-functions are more efficient than interpretation-functions. We give a\ndetailed analysis of an ad-hoc protocol on which the witness-functions succeed\nin proving its correctness for secrecy while the interpretation-functions fail\nto do so.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1 |\n| 7 | 20979 | Dissecting the multivariate extremal index and tail dependence   A central issue in the theory of extreme values focuses on suitable\nconditions such that the well-known results for the limiting distributions of\nthe maximum of i.i.d. sequences can be applied to stationary ones. In this\ncontext, the extremal index appears as a key parameter to capture the effect of\ntemporal dependence on the limiting distribution of the maxima. The\nmultivariate extremal index corresponds to a generalization of this concept to\na multivariate context and affects the tail dependence structure within the\nmarginal sequences and between them. As it is a function, the inference becomes\nmore difficult, and it is therefore important to obtain characterizations,\nnamely bounds based on the marginal dependence that are easier to estimate. In\nthis work we present two decompositions that emphasize different types of\ninformation contained in the multivariate extremal index, an upper limit better\nthan those found in the literature and we analyze its role in dependence on the\nlimiting model of the componentwise maxima of a stationary sequence. We will\nillustrate the results with examples of recognized interest in applications.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1 |\n| 9 | 20981 | Natural Language Does Not Emerge 'Naturally' in Multi-Agent Dialog   A number of recent works have proposed techniques for end-to-end learning of\ncommunication protocols among cooperative multi-agent populations, and have\nsimultaneously found the emergence of grounded human-interpretable language in\nthe protocols developed by the agents, all learned without any human\nsupervision!\nIn this paper, using a Task and Tell reference game between two agents as a\ntestbed, we present a sequence of 'negative' results culminating in a\n'positive' one -- showing that while most agent-invented languages are\neffective (i.e. achieve near-perfect task rewards), they are decidedly not\ninterpretable or compositional.\nIn essence, we find that natural language does not emerge 'naturally',\ndespite the semblance of ease of natural-language-emergence that one may gather\nfrom recent literature.

We lay the foundation of a\nuniversal model that is trained on multiple languages at once. As affect is\nshared across all languages, we are able to leverage shared information between\nlanguages and improve the overall performance for each one. We obtained an\naverage improvement of 12.8% on emotion and 10.1% on personality when compared\nwith the same model trained on each language only. It is end-to-end because we\ndirectly take narrow-band raw waveforms as input. This allows us to accept as\ninput audio recorded from any source and to avoid the overhead and information\nloss of feature extraction. It outperforms a similar CNN using spectrograms as\ninput by 12.8% for emotion and 6.3% for personality, based on F-scores.\nAnalysis of the network parameters and layers activation shows that the network\nlearns and extracts significant features in the first layer, in particular\npitch, energy and contour variations. Subsequent convolutional layers instead\ncapture language-specific representations through the analysis of\nsupra-segmental features. Our model represents an important step for the\ndevelopment of a fully universal affect recognizer, able to recognize\nadditional descriptors, such as stress, and for the future implementation into\naffective interactive systems.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1 |\n| 16 | 20988 | Controller-jammer game models of Denial of Service in control systems operating over packet-dropping links   The paper introduces a class of zero-sum games between the adversary and\ncontroller as a scenario for a `denial of service' in a networked control\nsystem. The communication link is modeled as a set of transmission regimes\ncontrolled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage an attack on the\nplant by choosing a most damaging regime-switching strategy. We demonstrate\nthat even in the one-step case, the introduced games admit a saddle-point\nequilibrium, at which the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region\nof the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a\nnontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard\nstochastic control problem over a packet dropping link. The paper derives\nconditions for the introduced games to have such a saddle-point equilibrium.\nFurthermore, we show that in more general multi-stage games, these conditions\nprovide `greedy' jamming strategies for the adversary.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1 |\n| 17 | 20989 | Conservation of spin supercurrents in superconductors   We demonstrate that spin supercurrents are conserved upon transmission\nthrough a conventional superconductor, even in the presence of spin-dependent\nscattering by impurities with magnetic moments or spin-orbit coupling.

These sensors\nare omnipresent and help the car navigate, reduce accidents, and provide\ncomfortable rides. However, they can also be used to learn about the drivers\nthemselves. In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data\ncollected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of\nindividuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where\nour dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by\nmultiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each\nindividual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short\nroad segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI\nAG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped\nwith automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show\nthat turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across\ndrivers, especially when compared to straightaways. We then focus on the 12\nmost frequently made turns in the dataset, which include rural, urban, highway\non-ramps, and more, obtaining accurate identification results and learning\nuseful insights about driver behavior in a variety of settings.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 1 |\n| 20 | 20992 | Hyper-dimensional computing for a visual question-answering system that is trainable end-to-end   In this work we propose a system for visual question answering.

An inner time series contains information that does not depend on\nthe nature of the sensors, which the observer chose to monitor the system.\nInstead, it encodes information that is intrinsic to the evolution of the\nobserved system. Because of its sensor-independence, an inner time series may\nproduce fewer false negatives when it is used to detect events in the presence\nof sensor drift. Furthermore, if the observed physical system is comprised of\nnon-interacting subsystems, its inner time series is separable; i.e., it\nconsists of a collection of time series, each one being the inner time series\nof an isolated subsystem. Because of this property, an inner time series can be\nused to detect a specific behavior of one of the independent subsystems without\nusing blind source separation to disentangle that subsystem from the others.\nThe method is illustrated by applying it to: 1) an analytic example; 2) the\naudio waveform of one speaker; 3) video images from a moving camera; 4)\nmixtures of audio waveforms of two speakers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1 |\n| 23 | 20995 | Towards Binary-Valued Gates for Robust LSTM Training   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent\nstructures in sequence modeling. It aims to use gates to control information\nflow (e.g., whether to skip some information or not) in the recurrent\ncomputations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only\npartially achieves this goal. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM\ntraining, which pushes the output values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing\nso, we can better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or\nclosed, instead of in a middle state, which makes the results more\ninterpretable. Empirical studies show that (1) Although it seems that we\nrestrict the model capacity, there is no performance drop: we achieve better or\ncomparable performances due to its better generalization ability; (2) The\noutputs of gates are not sensitive to their inputs: we can easily compress the\nLSTM unit in multiple ways, e.g., low-rank approximation and low-precision\napproximation. The compressed models are even better than the baseline models\nwithout compression.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1 |\n| 24 | 20996 | GUB Covers and Power-Indexed formulations for Wireless Network Design   We propose a pure 0-1 formulation for the wireless network design problem,\ni.e. the problem of configuring a set of transmitters to provide service\ncoverage to a set of receivers. In contrast with classical mixed integer\nformulations, where power emissions are represented by continuous variables, we\nconsider only a finite set of powers values. This has two major advantages: it\nbetter fits the usual practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems\nwhich heavily affect continuous models. A crucial ingredient of our approach is\nan effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing the\ncoverage condition of a receiver. This formulation is based on the GUB cover\ninequalities introduced by Wolsey (1990) and its core is an extension of the\nexact formulation of the GUB knapsack polytope with two GUB constraints.

Commercially available FES\nproducts are open loop, meaning that the system is unable to adapt to changing\nconditions with the user and their muscles which results in muscle fatigue and\npoor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop\nbetween stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive\nstimulation. FES causes electrical artefacts which make it challenging to\nmonitor muscle contractions with traditional methods such as electromyography\n(EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with novel\nmechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during\nstimulation in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling\nrig with a software interface that enabled us to perform adaptive recording and\nstimulation, and then combine this with sensors to record forces applied to the\npedals using force sensitive resistors (FSRs), crank angle position using a\nmagnetic incremental encoder and inputs from the user using switches and a\npotentiometer. We illustrated this with a closed-loop stimulation algorithm\nthat used the inputs from the sensors to control the output of a programmable\nRehaStim 1 FES stimulator (Hasomed) in real-time. This recumbent bicycle rig\nwas used as a testing platform for FES cycling. The algorithm was designed to\nrespond to a change in requested speed (RPM) from the user and change the\nstimulation power (% of maximum current mA) until this speed was achieved and\nthen maintain it.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1 |\n| 31 | 21003 | QT2S: A System for Monitoring Road Traffic via Fine Grounding of Tweets   Social media platforms provide continuous access to user generated content\nthat enables real-time monitoring of user behavior and of events.

This paper\nproposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA$\\theta$) which enables a\ncontinuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More\nspecifically, we make three main contributions to the existing literature.\nFirst, our approach allows the decision maker to continuously vary between\nconcepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence, the algorithm\nenables the decision maker to adopt intermediate \"worldviews\" on the degree of\ndiscrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to the extreme\ncases of \"we're all equal\" (WAE) and \"what you see is what you get\" (WYSIWYG)\nproposed so far in the literature.

We discuss three main examples\n(college admissions; credit application; insurance contracts) and map out the\npolicy implications of our approach. The explicit formalization of the\ntrade-off between individual and group fairness allows this post-processing\napproach to be tailored to different situational contexts in which one or the\nother fairness criterion may take precedence.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 1 |\n| 45 | 21017 | Coupling geometry on binary bipartite networks: hypotheses testing on pattern geometry and nestedness   Upon a matrix representation of a binary bipartite network, via the\npermutation invariance, a coupling geometry is computed to approximate the\nminimum energy macrostate of a network's system. Such a macrostate is supposed\nto constitute the intrinsic structures of the system, so that the coupling\ngeometry should be taken as information contents, or even the nonparametric\nminimum sufficient statistics of the network data. Then pertinent null and\nalternative hypotheses, such as nestedness, are to be formulated according to\nthe macrostate. That is, any efficient testing statistic needs to be a function\nof this coupling geometry. These conceptual architectures and mechanisms are by\nand large still missing in community ecology literature, and rendered\nmisconceptions prevalent in this research area. Here the algorithmically\ncomputed coupling geometry is shown consisting of deterministic multiscale\nblock patterns, which are framed by two marginal ultrametric trees on row and\ncolumn axes, and stochastic uniform randomness within each block found on the\nfinest scale. Functionally a series of increasingly larger ensembles of matrix\nmimicries is derived by conforming to the multiscale block configurations. Here\nmatrix mimicking is meant to be subject to constraints of row and column sums\nsequences. Based on such a series of ensembles, a profile of distributions\nbecomes a natural device for checking the validity of testing statistics or\nstructural indexes. An energy based index is used for testing whether network\ndata indeed contains structural geometry. A new version block-based nestedness\nindex is also proposed. Its validity is checked and compared with the existing\nones.

In this formulation, the attacker has\naccess to a noisy observation of the group membership of each user in the\nsocial network. When an unidentified victim visits a malicious website, the\nattacker uses browser history sniffing to make queries regarding the victim's\nsocial media activity. Particularly, it can make polar queries regarding the\nvictim's group memberships and the victim's identity. The attacker receives\nnoisy responses to her queries. The goal is to de-anonymize the victim with the\nminimum number of queries. Starting with a rigorous mathematical model for this\nactive de-anonymization problem, an upper bound on the attacker's expected\nquery cost is derived, and new attack algorithms are proposed which achieve\nthis bound. These algorithms vary in computational cost and performance. The\nresults suggest that prior heuristic approaches to this problem provide\nsub-optimal solutions.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1 |\n| 50 | 21022 | Geobiodynamics and Roegenian Economic Systems   This mathematical essay brings together ideas from Economics, Geobiodynamics\nand Thermodynamics.

In this paper, we optimize an energy harvesting\ntransmitter, communicating over a slow fading channel, using layered coding.\nThe transmitter has access to the channel statistics, but does not know the\nexact channel state. In layered coding, the codewords are first designed for\neach of the channel states at different rates, and then the codewords are\neither time-multiplexed or superimposed before the transmission, leading to two\ntransmission strategies. The receiver then decodes the information adaptively\nbased on the realized channel state. The transmitter is equipped with a\nfinite-capacity battery having non-zero internal resistance.

In many domains, the two processes are approached\nthrough rules: high-level principles that reveal invariances within similar yet\ndiverse examples. Under a probabilistic setting for discrete input spaces, we\nfocus on the rule realization problem which generates input sample\ndistributions that follow the given rules.

A simple\napproach is Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which estimates the risk in\nthe data space, while a recent modification (GSURE) estimates the risk in the\nspace of the unknown variable. It seems intuitive that the latter is more\nappropriate for ill-posed problems, since the properties in the data space do\nnot tell much about the quality of the reconstruction. We provide theoretical\nstudies of both estimators for linear Tikhonov regularization in a finite\ndimensional setting and estimate the quality of the risk estimators, which also\nleads to asymptotic convergence results as the dimension of the problem tends\nto infinity. Unlike previous papers, who studied image processing problems with\na very low degree of ill-posedness, we are interested in the behavior of the\nrisk estimators for increasing ill-posedness. Interestingly, our theoretical\nresults indicate that the quality of the GSURE risk can deteriorate\nasymptotically for ill-posed problems, which is confirmed by a detailed\nnumerical study. The latter shows that in many cases the GSURE estimator leads\nto extremely small regularization parameters, which obviously cannot stabilize\nthe reconstruction. Similar but less severe issues with respect to robustness\nalso appear for the SURE estimator, which in comparison to the rather\nconservative discrepancy principle leads to the conclusion that regularization\nparameter choice based on unbiased risk estimation is not a reliable procedure\nfor ill-posed problems. A similar numerical study for sparsity regularization\ndemonstrates that the same issue appears in nonlinear variational\nregularization approaches.\n                                                                           | 1 |\n| ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ |\n| 8917 | 29889 | Optical Imaging of Surface Chemistry and Dynamics in Confinement   The interfacial structure and dynamics of water in a microscopically confined\ngeometry is imaged in three dimensions and on millisecond time scales.

However, recent attacks on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P)\nnetwork demonstrated that its gossip-based flooding protocols, which are used\nto ensure global network consistency, may enable user deanonymization---the\nlinkage of a user's IP address with her pseudonym in the Bitcoin network. In\n2015, the Bitcoin community responded to these attacks by changing the\nnetwork's flooding mechanism to a different protocol, known as diffusion.\nHowever, no systematic justification was provided for the change, and it is\nunclear if diffusion actually improves the system's anonymity. In this paper,\nwe model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties,\nboth pre- and post-2015. In doing so, we consider new adversarial models and\nspreading mechanisms that have not been previously studied in the\nsource-finding literature. We theoretically prove that Bitcoin's networking\nprotocols (both pre- and post-2015) offer poor anonymity properties on networks\nwith a regular-tree topology.

If one adopts linear coupling in the\nchain and piecewise linear on-site force, then it is possible to develop\nwell-known exact solutions for the front and accompanying oscillatory tail. We\ndemonstrate that these solutions are essentially non-robust. Various\napproximations for the on-site potential with the same basic parameters (height\nand coordinate of the potential barrier, energy effect and distance between the\npotential wells) lead to substantially different front velocities. Besides,\ninclusion of even weak nearest neighbor nonlinearity drastically modifies the\nfront structure and parameters. The energy concentration in the front zone\nleads to a dominance of the nonlinear term. It turns out that the dynamics can\nbe efficiently studied in terms of an equivalent model with a single degree of\nfreedom. This estimation leads to accurate prediction of the front velocity and\nparameters of the oscillatory tail. Moreover, it turns out that the solution is\nrobust - exact shape of the on-site potential weakly effects the front\nparameters.

The aim of our analysis is to\nuncover factors influencing the retention of acquired knowledge, such as time\npassed or knowledge application, in order to improve long-term success. While\nwe know that some participants learned the programming basics within our\ncourse, we lack information on whether this knowledge was applied and fortified\nafter the course's end.

The first\npart of the survey elicits responses on whether and how MOOC knowledge was\napplied and gives participants opportunity to voice individual feedback. The\nsecond part of the survey contains several questions of increasing difficulty\nand complexity regarding course content in order to learn about the\nconsolidation of the acquired knowledge. We distinguish three programming\nknowledge areas in the survey: First, understanding of concepts, such as loops\nand boolean algebra. Second, syntax knowledge, such as specific keywords.\nThird, practical skills including debugging and coding. We further analyzed the\nlong-term effects separately per participant skill group.

Previous empirical work on this topic, which shows a diverse range of\nestimated effects, is based largely on outcome regression (OR) models using the\nEmpirical Bayes approach or on simple before and after comparisons. Issues of\ncausality and confounding have received little formal attention. A causal DR\napproach combines propensity score (PS) and OR models to give an average\ntreatment effect (ATE) estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal\nunder correct specification of either of the two component models. We develop\nthis approach within a novel approximate Bayesian framework to derive posterior\npredictive distributions for the ATE of speed cameras on road traffic\ncollisions.

In this\ncontext, the extremal index appears as a key parameter to capture the effect of\ntemporal dependence on the limiting distribution of the maxima. The\nmultivariate extremal index corresponds to a generalization of this concept to\na multivariate context and affects the tail dependence structure within the\nmarginal sequences and between them. As it is a function, the inference becomes\nmore difficult, and it is therefore important to obtain characterizations,\nnamely bounds based on the marginal dependence that are easier to estimate. In\nthis work we present two decompositions that emphasize different types of\ninformation contained in the multivariate extremal index, an upper limit better\nthan those found in the literature and we analyze its role in dependence on the\nlimiting model of the componentwise maxima of a stationary sequence.

We lay the foundation of a\nuniversal model that is trained on multiple languages at once. As affect is\nshared across all languages, we are able to leverage shared information between\nlanguages and improve the overall performance for each one. We obtained an\naverage improvement of 12.8\\% on emotion and 10.1\\% on personality when compared\nwith the same model trained on each language only. It is end-to-end because we\ndirectly take narrow-band raw waveforms as input. This allows us to accept as\ninput audio recorded from any source and to avoid the overhead and information\nloss of feature extraction. It outperforms a similar CNN using spectrograms as\ninput by 12.8\\% for emotion and 6.3\\% for personality, based on F-scores.\nAnalysis of the network parameters and layers activation shows that the network\nlearns and extracts significant features in the first layer, in particular\npitch, energy and contour variations. Subsequent convolutional layers instead\ncapture language-specific representations through the analysis of\nsupra-segmental features. Our model represents an important step for the\ndevelopment of a fully universal affect recognizer, able to recognize\nadditional descriptors, such as stress, and for the future implementation into\naffective interactive systems.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 1\\\\\n\t16 & 20988 & Controller-jammer game models of Denial of Service in control systems operating over packet-dropping links   The paper introduces a class of zero-sum games between the adversary and\ncontroller as a scenario for a `denial of service' in a networked control\nsystem. The communication link is modeled as a set of transmission regimes\ncontrolled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage an attack on the\nplant by choosing a most damaging regime-switching strategy. We demonstrate\nthat even in the one-step case, the introduced games admit a saddle-point\nequilibrium, at which the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region\nof the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a\nnontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard\nstochastic control problem over a packet dropping link. The paper derives\nconditions for the introduced games to have such a saddle-point equilibrium.\nFurthermore, we show that in more general multi-stage games, these conditions\nprovide `greedy' jamming strategies for the adversary.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 1\\\\\n\t17 & 20989 & Conservation of spin supercurrents in superconductors   We demonstrate that spin supercurrents are conserved upon transmission\nthrough a conventional superconductor, even in the presence of spin-dependent\nscattering by impurities with magnetic moments or spin-orbit coupling.

These sensors\nare omnipresent and help the car navigate, reduce accidents, and provide\ncomfortable rides. However, they can also be used to learn about the drivers\nthemselves. In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data\ncollected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of\nindividuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where\nour dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by\nmultiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each\nindividual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short\nroad segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI\nAG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped\nwith automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show\nthat turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across\ndrivers, especially when compared to straightaways. We then focus on the 12\nmost frequently made turns in the dataset, which include rural, urban, highway\non-ramps, and more, obtaining accurate identification results and learning\nuseful insights about driver behavior in a variety of settings.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & 1\\\\\n\t20 & 20992 & Hyper-dimensional computing for a visual question-answering system that is trainable end-to-end   In this work we propose a system for visual question answering.

This choice has the advantage\nthat all the operations in the system, namely creating the knowledge base and\nevaluating the questions against it, are differentiable, thereby making the\nsystem easily trainable in an end-to-end fashion.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 1\\\\\n\t21 & 20993 & The Inner Structure of Time-Dependent Signals   This paper shows how a time series of measurements of an evolving system can\nbe processed to create an inner time series that is unaffected by any\ninstantaneous invertible, possibly nonlinear transformation of the\nmeasurements. An inner time series contains information that does not depend on\nthe nature of the sensors, which the observer chose to monitor the system.\nInstead, it encodes information that is intrinsic to the evolution of the\nobserved system. Because of its sensor-independence, an inner time series may\nproduce fewer false negatives when it is used to detect events in the presence\nof sensor drift. Furthermore, if the observed physical system is comprised of\nnon-interacting subsystems, its inner time series is separable; i.e., it\nconsists of a collection of time series, each one being the inner time series\nof an isolated subsystem. Because of this property, an inner time series can be\nused to detect a specific behavior of one of the independent subsystems without\nusing blind source separation to disentangle that subsystem from the others.\nThe method is illustrated by applying it to: 1) an analytic example; 2) the\naudio waveform of one speaker; 3) video images from a moving camera; 4)\nmixtures of audio waveforms of two speakers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 1\\\\\n\t23 & 20995 & Towards Binary-Valued Gates for Robust LSTM Training   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent\nstructures in sequence modeling. It aims to use gates to control information\nflow (e.g., whether to skip some information or not) in the recurrent\ncomputations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only\npartially achieves this goal. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM\ntraining, which pushes the output values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing\nso, we can better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or\nclosed, instead of in a middle state, which makes the results more\ninterpretable. Empirical studies show that (1) Although it seems that we\nrestrict the model capacity, there is no performance drop: we achieve better or\ncomparable performances due to its better generalization ability; (2) The\noutputs of gates are not sensitive to their inputs: we can easily compress the\nLSTM unit in multiple ways, e.g., low-rank approximation and low-precision\napproximation. The compressed models are even better than the baseline models\nwithout compression.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 1\\\\\n\t24 & 20996 & GUB Covers and Power-Indexed formulations for Wireless Network Design   We propose a pure 0-1 formulation for the wireless network design problem,\ni.e. the problem of configuring a set of transmitters to provide service\ncoverage to a set of receivers. In contrast with classical mixed integer\nformulations, where power emissions are represented by continuous variables, we\nconsider only a finite set of powers values. This has two major advantages: it\nbetter fits the usual practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems\nwhich heavily affect continuous models. A crucial ingredient of our approach is\nan effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing the\ncoverage condition of a receiver. This formulation is based on the GUB cover\ninequalities introduced by Wolsey (1990) and its core is an extension of the\nexact formulation of the GUB knapsack polytope with two GUB constraints. This\nspecial case corresponds to the very common practical situation where only one\nmajor interferer is present. We assess the effectiveness of our formulation by\ncomprehensive computational results over realistic instances of two typical\ntechnologies, namely WiMAX and DVB-T.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & 1\\\\\n\t25 & 20997 & Orbital contributions to the electron g-factor in semiconductor nanowires   Recent experiments on Majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires {[}Albrecht\net al., Nat. 531, 206 (2016){]} revealed a surprisingly large electronic Landé\ng-factor, several times larger than the bulk value - contrary to the\nexpectation that confinement reduces the g-factor. Here we assess the role of\norbital contributions to the electron g-factor in nanowires and quantum dots.\nWe show that an LS coupling in higher subbands leads to an enhancement of the\ng-factor of an order of magnitude or more for small effective mass\nsemiconductors. We validate our theoretical finding with simulations of InAs\nand InSb, showing that the effect persists even if cylindrical symmetry is\nbroken.

Commercially available FES\nproducts are open loop, meaning that the system is unable to adapt to changing\nconditions with the user and their muscles which results in muscle fatigue and\npoor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop\nbetween stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive\nstimulation. FES causes electrical artefacts which make it challenging to\nmonitor muscle contractions with traditional methods such as electromyography\n(EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with novel\nmechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during\nstimulation in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling\nrig with a software interface that enabled us to perform adaptive recording and\nstimulation, and then combine this with sensors to record forces applied to the\npedals using force sensitive resistors (FSRs), crank angle position using a\nmagnetic incremental encoder and inputs from the user using switches and a\npotentiometer. We illustrated this with a closed-loop stimulation algorithm\nthat used the inputs from the sensors to control the output of a programmable\nRehaStim 1 FES stimulator (Hasomed) in real-time. This recumbent bicycle rig\nwas used as a testing platform for FES cycling. The algorithm was designed to\nrespond to a change in requested speed (RPM) from the user and change the\nstimulation power (\\% of maximum current mA) until this speed was achieved and\nthen maintain it.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 1\\\\\n\t31 & 21003 & QT2S: A System for Monitoring Road Traffic via Fine Grounding of Tweets   Social media platforms provide continuous access to user generated content\nthat enables real-time monitoring of user behavior and of events. The\ngeographical dimension of such user behavior and events has recently caught a\nlot of attention in several domains: mobility, humanitarian, or\ninfrastructural. While resolving the location of a user can be straightforward,\ndepending on the affordances of their device and/or of the application they are\nusing, in most cases, locating a user demands a larger effort, such as\nexploiting textual features. On Twitter for instance, only 2\\% of all tweets are\ngeo-referenced. In this paper, we present a system for zoomed-in grounding\n(below city level) for short messages (e.g., tweets). The system combines\ndifferent natural language processing and machine learning techniques to\nincrease the number of geo-grounded tweets, which is essential to many\napplications such as disaster response and real-time traffic monitoring.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & 1\\\\\n\t36 & 21008 & A continuous framework for fairness   Increasingly, discrimination by algorithms is perceived as a societal and\nlegal problem. As a response, a number of criteria for implementing algorithmic\nfairness in machine learning have been developed in the literature. This paper\nproposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA\\$\\textbackslash{}theta\\$) which enables a\ncontinuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More\nspecifically, we make three main contributions to the existing literature.\nFirst, our approach allows the decision maker to continuously vary between\nconcepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence, the algorithm\nenables the decision maker to adopt intermediate \"worldviews\" on the degree of\ndiscrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to the extreme\ncases of \"we're all equal\" (WAE) and \"what you see is what you get\" (WYSIWYG)\nproposed so far in the literature. Second, we use optimal transport theory, and\nspecifically the concept of the barycenter, to maximize decision maker utility\nunder the chosen fairness constraints. Third, the algorithm is able to handle\ncases of intersectionality, i.e., of multi-dimensional discrimination of\ncertain groups on grounds of several criteria. We discuss three main examples\n(college admissions; credit application; insurance contracts) and map out the\npolicy implications of our approach. The explicit formalization of the\ntrade-off between individual and group fairness allows this post-processing\napproach to be tailored to different situational contexts in which one or the\nother fairness criterion may take precedence.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & 1\\\\\n\t45 & 21017 & Coupling geometry on binary bipartite networks: hypotheses testing on pattern geometry and nestedness   Upon a matrix representation of a binary bipartite network, via the\npermutation invariance, a coupling geometry is computed to approximate the\nminimum energy macrostate of a network's system. Such a macrostate is supposed\nto constitute the intrinsic structures of the system, so that the coupling\ngeometry should be taken as information contents, or even the nonparametric\nminimum sufficient statistics of the network data. Then pertinent null and\nalternative hypotheses, such as nestedness, are to be formulated according to\nthe macrostate. That is, any efficient testing statistic needs to be a function\nof this coupling geometry. These conceptual architectures and mechanisms are by\nand large still missing in community ecology literature, and rendered\nmisconceptions prevalent in this research area. Here the algorithmically\ncomputed coupling geometry is shown consisting of deterministic multiscale\nblock patterns, which are framed by two marginal ultrametric trees on row and\ncolumn axes, and stochastic uniform randomness within each block found on the\nfinest scale. Functionally a series of increasingly larger ensembles of matrix\nmimicries is derived by conforming to the multiscale block configurations. Here\nmatrix mimicking is meant to be subject to constraints of row and column sums\nsequences. Based on such a series of ensembles, a profile of distributions\nbecomes a natural device for checking the validity of testing statistics or\nstructural indexes. An energy based index is used for testing whether network\ndata indeed contains structural geometry. A new version block-based nestedness\nindex is also proposed. Its validity is checked and compared with the existing\nones. A computing paradigm, called Data Mechanics, and its application on one\nreal data network are illustrated throughout the developments and discussions\nin this paper.\n & 1\\\\\n\t48 & 21020 & Load balancing with heterogeneous schedulers   Load balancing is a common approach in web server farms or inventory routing\nproblems. An important issue in such systems is to determine the server to\nwhich an incoming request should be routed to optimize a given performance\ncriteria. In this paper, we assume the server's scheduling disciplines to be\nheterogeneous. More precisely, a server implements a scheduling discipline\nwhich belongs to the class of limited processor sharing (LPS-\\$d\\$) scheduling\ndisciplines. Under LPS-\\$d\\$, up to \\$d\\$ jobs can be served simultaneously, and\nhence, includes as special cases First Come First Served (\\$d=1\\$) and Processor\nSharing (\\$d=\\textbackslash{}infty\\$).\nIn order to obtain efficient heuristics, we model the above load-balancing\nframework as a multi-armed restless bandit problem. Using the relaxation\ntechnique, as first developed in the seminal work of Whittle, we derive\nWhittle's index policy for general cost functions and obtain a closed-form\nexpression for Whittle's index in terms of the steady-state distribution.\nThrough numerical computations, we investigate the performance of Whittle's\nindex with two different performance criteria: linear cost criterion and a cost\ncriterion that depends on the first and second moment of the throughput. Our\nresults show that \\textbackslash{}emph\\{(i)\\} the structure of Whittle's index policy can\nstrongly depend on the scheduling discipline implemented in the server, i.e.,\non \\$d\\$, and that \\textbackslash{}emph\\{(ii)\\} Whittle's index policy significantly outperforms\nstandard dispatching rules such as Join the Shortest Queue (JSQ), Join the\nShortest Expected Workload (JSEW), and Random Server allocation (RSA).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 1\\\\\n\t49 & 21021 & An Information Theoretic Framework for Active De-anonymization in Social Networks Based on Group Memberships   In this paper, a new mathematical formulation for the problem of\nde-anonymizing social network users by actively querying their membership in\nsocial network groups is introduced. In this formulation, the attacker has\naccess to a noisy observation of the group membership of each user in the\nsocial network. When an unidentified victim visits a malicious website, the\nattacker uses browser history sniffing to make queries regarding the victim's\nsocial media activity. Particularly, it can make polar queries regarding the\nvictim's group memberships and the victim's identity. The attacker receives\nnoisy responses to her queries. The goal is to de-anonymize the victim with the\nminimum number of queries. Starting with a rigorous mathematical model for this\nactive de-anonymization problem, an upper bound on the attacker's expected\nquery cost is derived, and new attack algorithms are proposed which achieve\nthis bound. These algorithms vary in computational cost and performance. The\nresults suggest that prior heuristic approaches to this problem provide\nsub-optimal solutions.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 1\\\\\n\t50 & 21022 & Geobiodynamics and Roegenian Economic Systems   This mathematical essay brings together ideas from Economics, Geobiodynamics\nand Thermodynamics.

In this paper, we optimize an energy harvesting\ntransmitter, communicating over a slow fading channel, using layered coding.\nThe transmitter has access to the channel statistics, but does not know the\nexact channel state. In layered coding, the codewords are first designed for\neach of the channel states at different rates, and then the codewords are\neither time-multiplexed or superimposed before the transmission, leading to two\ntransmission strategies.

However,\nthe contents of cellular tomograms are often complex, making it difficult to\nautomatically isolate different in situ cellular components. In this paper, we\npropose a convolutional autoencoder-based unsupervised approach to provide a\ncoarse grouping of 3D small subvolumes extracted from tomograms. We demonstrate\nthat the autoencoder can be used for efficient and coarse characterization of\nfeatures of macromolecular complexes and surfaces, such as membranes. In\naddition, the autoencoder can be used to detect non-cellular features related\nto sample preparation and data collection, such as carbon edges from the grid\nand tomogram boundaries. The autoencoder is also able to detect patterns that\nmay indicate spatial interactions between cellular components. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that our autoencoder can be used for weakly supervised semantic\nsegmentation of cellular components, requiring a very small amount of manual\nannotation.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & 1\\\\\n\t60 & 21032 & Probabilistic Rule Realization and Selection   Abstraction and realization are bilateral processes that are key in deriving\nintelligence and creativity. In many domains, the two processes are approached\nthrough rules: high-level principles that reveal invariances within similar yet\ndiverse examples. Under a probabilistic setting for discrete input spaces, we\nfocus on the rule realization problem which generates input sample\ndistributions that follow the given rules. More ambitiously, we go beyond a\nmechanical realization that takes whatever is given, but instead ask for\nproactively selecting reasonable rules to realize. This goal is demanding in\npractice, since the initial rule set may not always be consistent and thus\nintelligent compromises are needed. We formulate both rule realization and\nselection as two strongly connected components within a single and symmetric\nbi-convex problem, and derive an efficient algorithm that works at large scale.\nTaking music compositional rules as the main example throughout the paper, we\ndemonstrate our model's efficiency in not only music realization (composition)\nbut also music interpretation and understanding (analysis).\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 1\\\\\n\t61 & 21033 & Asymptotic and numerical analysis of a porous medium model for transpiration-driven sap flow in trees   We develop a 3D porous medium model for sap flow within a tree stem, which\nconsists of a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation with a suitable\ntranspiration source term. Using an asymptotic analysis, we derive approximate\nseries solutions for the liquid saturation and sap velocity for a general class\nof coefficient functions.

A simple\napproach is Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which estimates the risk in\nthe data space, while a recent modification (GSURE) estimates the risk in the\nspace of the unknown variable. It seems intuitive that the latter is more\nappropriate for ill-posed problems, since the properties in the data space do\nnot tell much about the quality of the reconstruction. We provide theoretical\nstudies of both estimators for linear Tikhonov regularization in a finite\ndimensional setting and estimate the quality of the risk estimators, which also\nleads to asymptotic convergence results as the dimension of the problem tends\nto infinity. Unlike previous papers, who studied image processing problems with\na very low degree of ill-posedness, we are interested in the behavior of the\nrisk estimators for increasing ill-posedness. Interestingly, our theoretical\nresults indicate that the quality of the GSURE risk can deteriorate\nasymptotically for ill-posed problems, which is confirmed by a detailed\nnumerical study. The latter shows that in many cases the GSURE estimator leads\nto extremely small regularization parameters, which obviously cannot stabilize\nthe reconstruction. Similar but less severe issues with respect to robustness\nalso appear for the SURE estimator, which in comparison to the rather\nconservative discrepancy principle leads to the conclusion that regularization\nparameter choice based on unbiased risk estimation is not a reliable procedure\nfor ill-posed problems. A similar numerical study for sparsity regularization\ndemonstrates that the same issue appears in nonlinear variational\nregularization approaches.\n                                                                           & 1\\\\\n\t⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮\\\\\n\t8917 & 29889 & Optical Imaging of Surface Chemistry and Dynamics in Confinement   The interfacial structure and dynamics of water in a microscopically confined\ngeometry is imaged in three dimensions and on millisecond time scales.

Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime\nbehavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results.

This paper proposes a new\nsolution based on static analysis for automatically generating a performant\nexplicit-signal program from its corresponding implicit-signal implementation.\nThe key idea is to generate verification conditions that allow us to minimize\nthe number of required signals and unnecessary context switches, while\nguaranteeing semantic equivalence between the source and target programs. We\nhave implemented our method in a tool called Expresso and evaluate it on\nchallenging benchmarks from prior papers and open-source software.\nExpresso-generated code significantly outperforms past automatic signaling\nmechanisms (avg. 1.56x speedup) and closely matches the performance of\nhand-optimized explicit-signal code.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & 1\\\\\n\t8930 & 29902 & Stochastic gene expression with a multistate promoter: breaking down exact distributions   We consider a stochastic model of gene expression in which transcription\ndepends on a multistate promoter, including the famous two-state model and\nrefractory promoters as special cases, and focus on deriving the exact\nstationary distribution. Building upon several successful approaches, we\npresent a more unified viewpoint that enables us to simplify and generalize\nexisting results. In particular, the original jump process is deeply related to\na multivariate piecewise-deterministic Markov process that may also be of\ninterest beyond the biological field. In a very particular case of promoter\nconfiguration, this underlying process is shown to have a simple Dirichlet\nstationary distribution.

To this aim, we describe a scientist's profile by three\nmain aspects: the scientist's recent scientific career, the quality of their\nscientific environment and the structure of their scientific collaboration\nnetwork. We then design and implement a two-stage predictive model: first, we\nuse data mining to predict which researcher will move in the next year on the\nbasis of their scientific profile; second we predict which institution they\nwill choose by using a novel social-gravity model, an adaptation of the\ntraditional gravity model of human mobility. Experiments on a massive dataset\nof scientific publications show that our approach performs well in both the\nstages, resulting in a 85\\% reduction of the prediction error with respect to\nthe state-of-the-art approaches.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & 1\\\\\n\t8944 & 29916 & Faster Subgradient Methods for Functions with Hölderian Growth   The purpose of this manuscript is to derive new convergence results for\nseveral subgradient methods applied to minimizing nonsmooth convex functions\nwith Hölderian growth. The growth condition is satisfied in many applications\nand includes functions with quadratic growth and weakly sharp minima as special\ncases. To this end there are three main contributions. First, for a constant\nand sufficiently small stepsize, we show that the subgradient method achieves\nlinear convergence up to a certain region including the optimal set, with error\nof the order of the stepsize. Second, if appropriate problem parameters are\nknown, we derive a decaying stepsize which obtains a much faster convergence\nrate than is suggested by the classical \\$O(1/\\textbackslash{}sqrt\\{k\\})\\$ result for the\nsubgradient method. Thirdly we develop a novel \"descending stairs\" stepsize\nwhich obtains this faster convergence rate and also obtains linear convergence\nfor the special case of weakly sharp functions. We also develop an adaptive\nvariant of the \"descending stairs\" stepsize which achieves the same convergence\nrate without requiring an error bound constant which is difficult to estimate\nin practice.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & 1\\\\\n\t8947 & 29919 & Amanuensis: The Programmer's Apprentice   This document provides an overview of the material covered in a course taught\nat Stanford in the spring quarter of 2018. The course draws upon insight from\ncognitive and systems neuroscience to implement hybrid connectionist and\nsymbolic reasoning systems that leverage and extend the state of the art in\nmachine learning by integrating human and machine intelligence. As a concrete\nexample we focus on digital assistants that learn from continuous dialog with\nan expert software engineer while providing initial value as powerful\nanalytical, computational and mathematical savants. Over time these savants\nlearn cognitive strategies (domain-relevant problem solving skills) and develop\nintuitions (heuristics and the experience necessary for applying them) by\nlearning from their expert associates. By doing so these savants elevate their\ninnate analytical skills allowing them to partner on an equal footing as\nversatile collaborators - effectively serving as cognitive extensions and\ndigital prostheses, thereby amplifying and emulating their human partner's\nconceptually-flexible thinking patterns and enabling improved access to and\ncontrol over powerful computing resources.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 1\\\\\n\t8948 & 29920 & Convolutional Phase Retrieval via Gradient Descent   We study the convolutional phase retrieval problem, which considers\nrecovering an unknown signal \\$\\textbackslash{}mathbf x \\textbackslash{}in \\textbackslash{}mathbb C\\textasciicircum{}n \\$ from \\$m\\$ measurements\nconsisting of the magnitude of its cyclic convolution with a known kernel\n\\$\\textbackslash{}mathbf a \\textbackslash{}in \\textbackslash{}mathbb C\\textasciicircum{}m \\$. This model is motivated by applications such as\nchannel estimation, optics, and underwater acoustic communication, where the\nsignal of interest is acted on by a given channel/filter, and phase information\nis difficult or impossible to acquire. We show that when \\$\\textbackslash{}mathbf a\\$ is random\nand the sample number \\$m\\$ is sufficiently large, with high probability \\$\\textbackslash{}mathbf\nx\\$ can be efficiently recovered up to a global phase using a combination of\nspectral initialization and generalized gradient descent. The main challenge is\ncoping with dependencies in the measurement operator. We overcome this\nchallenge by using ideas from decoupling theory, suprema of chaos processes and\nthe restricted isometry property of random circulant matrices, and recent\nanalysis for alternating minimization methods.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & 1\\\\\n\t8952 & 29924 & Minimum Covariance Determinant and Extensions   The Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) method is a highly robust estimator\nof multivariate location and scatter, for which a fast algorithm is available.\nSince estimating the covariance matrix is the cornerstone of many multivariate\nstatistical methods, the MCD is an important building block when developing\nrobust multivariate techniques. It also serves as a convenient and efficient\ntool for outlier detection. The MCD estimator is reviewed, along with its main\nproperties such as affine equivariance, breakdown value, and influence\nfunction. We discuss its computation, and list applications and extensions of\nthe MCD in applied and methodological multivariate statistics. Two recent\nextensions of the MCD are described. The first one is a fast deterministic\nalgorithm which inherits the robustness of the MCD while being almost affine\nequivariant. The second is tailored to high-dimensional data, possibly with\nmore dimensions than cases, and incorporates regularization to prevent singular\nmatrices.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 1\\\\\n\t8953 & 29925 & Typed Table Transformations   Spreadsheet tables are often labeled, and these labels effectively constitute\ntypes for the data in the table.

An Analysis of the Fingerprintability of Tor Onion Services   Recent studies have shown that Tor onion (hidden) service websites are\nparticularly vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks due to their limited\nnumber and sensitive nature. In this work we present a multi-level feature\nanalysis of onion site fingerprintability, considering three state-of-the-art\nwebsite fingerprinting methods and 482 Tor onion services, making this the\nlargest analysis of this kind completed on onion services to date.\nPrior studies typically report average performance results for a given\nwebsite fingerprinting method or countermeasure. We investigate which sites are\nmore or less vulnerable to fingerprinting and which features make them so. We\nfind that there is a high variability in the rate at which sites are classified\n(and misclassified) by these attacks, implying that average performance figures\nmay not be informative of the risks that website fingerprinting attacks pose to\nparticular sites.\nWe analyze the features exploited by the different website fingerprinting\nmethods and discuss what makes onion service sites more or less easily\nidentifiable, both in terms of their traffic traces as well as their webpage\ndesign. We study misclassifications to understand how onion service sites can\nbe redesigned to be less vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks. Our\nresults also inform the design of website fingerprinting countermeasures and\ntheir evaluation considering disparate impact across sites.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 1\\\\\n\t8962 & 29934 & Anonymity Properties of the Bitcoin P2P Network   Bitcoin is a popular alternative to fiat money, widely used for its perceived\nanonymity properties. However, recent attacks on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P)\nnetwork demonstrated that its gossip-based flooding protocols, which are used\nto ensure global network consistency, may enable user deanonymization---the\nlinkage of a user's IP address with her pseudonym in the Bitcoin network. In\n2015, the Bitcoin community responded to these attacks by changing the\nnetwork's flooding mechanism to a different protocol, known as diffusion.\nHowever, no systematic justification was provided for the change, and it is\nunclear if diffusion actually improves the system's anonymity. In this paper,\nwe model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties,\nboth pre- and post-2015. In doing so, we consider new adversarial models and\nspreading mechanisms that have not been previously studied in the\nsource-finding literature. We theoretically prove that Bitcoin's networking\nprotocols (both pre- and post-2015) offer poor anonymity properties on networks\nwith a regular-tree topology. We validate this claim in simulation on a 2015\nsnapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 1\\\\\n\t8963 & 29935 & Propagation of transition front in bi-stable nondegenerate chains: model dependence and universality   We consider a propagation of transition fronts in one-dimensional chains with\nbi-stable nondegenerate on-site potential. If one adopts linear coupling in the\nchain and piecewise linear on-site force, then it is possible to develop\nwell-known exact solutions for the front and accompanying oscillatory tail. We\ndemonstrate that these solutions are essentially non-robust. Various\napproximations for the on-site potential with the same basic parameters (height\nand coordinate of the potential barrier, energy effect and distance between the\npotential wells) lead to substantially different front velocities. Besides,\ninclusion of even weak nearest neighbor nonlinearity drastically modifies the\nfront structure and parameters. The energy concentration in the front zone\nleads to a dominance of the nonlinear term. It turns out that the dynamics can\nbe efficiently studied in terms of an equivalent model with a single degree of\nfreedom. This estimation leads to accurate prediction of the front velocity and\nparameters of the oscillatory tail. Moreover, it turns out that the solution is\nrobust - exact shape of the on-site potential weakly effects the front\nparameters. This finding also conforms to the simplified model, since the\nlatter invokes only the general shape characteristics of the on-site potential.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 1\\\\\n\t8966 & 29938 & Studying Continuous Symmetry Breaking using Energy Level Spectroscopy   Tower of States analysis is a powerful tool for investigating phase\ntransitions in condensed matter systems. Spontaneous symmetry breaking implies\na specific structure of the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding quantum\nnumbers on finite systems. In these lecture notes we explain the group\nrepresentation theory used to derive the spectral structure for several\nscenarios of symmetry breaking. We give numerous examples to compute quantum\nnumbers of the degenerate groundstates, including translational symmetry\nbreaking or spin rotational symmetry breaking in Heisenberg antiferromagnets.\nThese results are then compared to actual numerical data from Exact\nDiagonalization.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 1\\\\\n\t8967 & 29939 & What Stays in Mind? - Retention Rates in Programming MOOCs   This work presents insights about the long-term effects and retention rates\nof knowledge acquired within MOOCs. In 2015 and 2017, we conducted two\nintroductory MOOCs on object-oriented programming in Java with each over 10,000\nregistered participants. In this paper, we analyze course scores, quiz results\nand self-stated skill levels of our participants. The aim of our analysis is to\nuncover factors influencing the retention of acquired knowledge, such as time\npassed or knowledge application, in order to improve long-term success. While\nwe know that some participants learned the programming basics within our\ncourse, we lack information on whether this knowledge was applied and fortified\nafter the course's end. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a survey in\n2018 among all participants of our 2015 and 2017 programming MOOCs. The first\npart of the survey elicits responses on whether and how MOOC knowledge was\napplied and gives participants opportunity to voice individual feedback. The\nsecond part of the survey contains several questions of increasing difficulty\nand complexity regarding course content in order to learn about the\nconsolidation of the acquired knowledge. We distinguish three programming\nknowledge areas in the survey: First, understanding of concepts, such as loops\nand boolean algebra. Second, syntax knowledge, such as specific keywords.\nThird, practical skills including debugging and coding. We further analyzed the\nlong-term effects separately per participant skill group. While answer rates\nwere low, the collected data shows a decrease of knowledge over time,\nrelatively unaffected by skill level. Application of the acquired knowledge\nimproves the memory retention rates of MOOC participants across all skill\nlevels.\n & 1\\\\\n\t8968 & 29940 & Scavenger 0.1: A Theorem Prover Based on Conflict Resolution   This paper introduces Scavenger, the first theorem prover for pure\nfirst-order logic without equality based on the new conflict resolution\ncalculus.

This fact is\nindependent on the fraction of the excited atoms in the stationary state.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & 1\\\\\n\t8974 & 29946 & Robust Regulation of MIMO systems: A Reformulation of the Internal Model Principle   The internal model principle is a fundamental result stating a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a stabilizing controller to be robustly regulating.\nIts classical formulation is given in terms of coprime factorizations and the\nlargest invariant factor of the signal generator which sets unnecessary\nrestrictions for the theory and its applicability.

Another factor of complexity, whereby the computation\nis allowed to take place in a precision different from the storage precisions\nof either A or B, is also included in the discussion. We first break the\nproblem into mostly orthogonal dimensions, considering the mixing of domains\nseparately from mixing precisions. Support for all combinations of matrix\noperands stored in either the real or complex domain is mapped out by\nenumerating the cases and describing an implementation approach for each.\nSupporting all combinations of storage and computation precisions is handled by\ntypecasting the matrices at key stages of the computation---during packing\nand/or accumulation, as needed. Several optional optimizations are also\ndocumented. Performance results gathered on a 56-core Marvell ThunderX2 and a\n52-core Intel Xeon Platinum demonstrate that high performance is mostly\npreserved, with modest slowdowns incurred from unavoidable typecast\ninstructions. The mixed-datatype implementation confirms that combinatoric\nintractability is avoided, with the framework relying on only two assembly\nmicrokernels to implement 128 datatype combinations.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 1\\\\\n\t8986 & 29958 & An axiomatic basis for Blackwell optimality   In the theory of Markov decision processes (MDPs), a Blackwell optimal policy\nis a policy that is optimal for every discount factor sufficiently close to\none.

Previous empirical work on this topic, which shows a diverse range of\nestimated effects, is based largely on outcome regression (OR) models using the\nEmpirical Bayes approach or on simple before and after comparisons. Issues of\ncausality and confounding have received little formal attention. A causal DR\napproach combines propensity score (PS) and OR models to give an average\ntreatment effect (ATE) estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal\nunder correct specification of either of the two component models. We develop\nthis approach within a novel approximate Bayesian framework to derive posterior\npredictive distributions for the ATE of speed cameras on road traffic\ncollisions. Our results for England indicate significant reductions in the\nnumber of collisions at speed cameras sites (mean ATE = -30\\%).

              "7    Dissecting the multivariate extremal index and tail dependence   A central issue in the theory of extreme values focuses on suitable\\nconditions such that the well-known results for the limiting distributions of\\nthe maximum of i.i.d. sequences can be applied to stationary ones. In this\\ncontext, the extremal index appears as a key parameter to capture the effect of\\ntemporal dependence on the limiting distribution of the maxima. The\\nmultivariate extremal index corresponds to a generalization of this concept to\\na multivariate context and affects the tail dependence structure within the\\nmarginal sequences and between them. As it is a function, the inference becomes\\nmore difficult, and it is therefore important to obtain characterizations,\\nnamely bounds based on the marginal dependence that are easier to estimate. In\\nthis work we present two decompositions that emphasize different types of\\ninformation contained in the multivariate extremal index, an upper limit better\\nthan those found in the literature and we analyze its role in dependence on the\\nlimiting model of the componentwise maxima of a stationary sequence.

              "12   Towards Universal End-to-End Affect Recognition from Multilingual Speech by ConvNets   We propose an end-to-end affect recognition approach using a Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) that handles multiple languages, with applications to\\nemotion and personality recognition from speech. We lay the foundation of a\\nuniversal model that is trained on multiple languages at once. As affect is\\nshared across all languages, we are able to leverage shared information between\\nlanguages and improve the overall performance for each one. We obtained an\\naverage improvement of 12.8% on emotion and 10.1% on personality when compared\\nwith the same model trained on each language only. It is end-to-end because we\\ndirectly take narrow-band raw waveforms as input. This allows us to accept as\\ninput audio recorded from any source and to avoid the overhead and information\\nloss of feature extraction. It outperforms a similar CNN using spectrograms as\\ninput by 12.8% for emotion and 6.3% for personality, based on F-scores.\\nAnalysis of the network parameters and layers activation shows that the network\\nlearns and extracts significant features in the first layer, in particular\\npitch, energy and contour variations. Subsequent convolutional layers instead\\ncapture language-specific representations through the analysis of\\nsupra-segmental features.

The communication link is modeled as a set of transmission regimes\\ncontrolled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage an attack on the\\nplant by choosing a most damaging regime-switching strategy. We demonstrate\\nthat even in the one-step case, the introduced games admit a saddle-point\\nequilibrium, at which the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region\\nof the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a\\nnontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard\\nstochastic control problem over a packet dropping link.

              "18   Driver Identification Using Automobile Sensor Data from a Single Turn   As automotive electronics continue to advance, cars are becoming more and\\nmore reliant on sensors to perform everyday driving operations. These sensors\\nare omnipresent and help the car navigate, reduce accidents, and provide\\ncomfortable rides. However, they can also be used to learn about the drivers\\nthemselves. In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data\\ncollected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of\\nindividuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where\\nour dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by\\nmultiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each\\nindividual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short\\nroad segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI\\nAG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped\\nwith automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show\\nthat turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across\\ndrivers, especially when compared to straightaways.

This choice has the advantage\\nthat all the operations in the system, namely creating the knowledge base and\\nevaluating the questions against it, are differentiable, thereby making the\\nsystem easily trainable in an end-to-end fashion.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

An inner time series contains information that does not depend on\\nthe nature of the sensors, which the observer chose to monitor the system.\\nInstead, it encodes information that is intrinsic to the evolution of the\\nobserved system. Because of its sensor-independence, an inner time series may\\nproduce fewer false negatives when it is used to detect events in the presence\\nof sensor drift. Furthermore, if the observed physical system is comprised of\\nnon-interacting subsystems, its inner time series is separable; i.e., it\\nconsists of a collection of time series, each one being the inner time series\\nof an isolated subsystem. Because of this property, an inner time series can be\\nused to detect a specific behavior of one of the independent subsystems without\\nusing blind source separation to disentangle that subsystem from the others.\\nThe method is illustrated by applying it to: 1) an analytic example; 2) the\\naudio waveform of one speaker; 3) video images from a moving camera; 4)\\nmixtures of audio waveforms of two speakers.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
              "23   Towards Binary-Valued Gates for Robust LSTM Training   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent\\nstructures in sequence modeling. It aims to use gates to control information\\nflow (e.g., whether to skip some information or not) in the recurrent\\ncomputations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only\\npartially achieves this goal. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM\\ntraining, which pushes the output values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing\\nso, we can better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or\\nclosed, instead of in a middle state, which makes the results more\\ninterpretable. Empirical studies show that (1) Although it seems that we\\nrestrict the model capacity, there is no performance drop: we achieve better or\\ncomparable performances due to its better generalization ability; (2) The\\noutputs of gates are not sensitive to their inputs: we can easily compress the\\nLSTM unit in multiple ways, e.g., low-rank approximation and low-precision\\napproximation. The compressed models are even better than the baseline models\\nwithout compression.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Commercially available FES\\nproducts are open loop, meaning that the system is unable to adapt to changing\\nconditions with the user and their muscles which results in muscle fatigue and\\npoor stimulation protocols. This is because it is difficult to close the loop\\nbetween stimulation and monitoring of muscle contraction using adaptive\\nstimulation. FES causes electrical artefacts which make it challenging to\\nmonitor muscle contractions with traditional methods such as electromyography\\n(EMG). We look to overcome this limitation by combining FES with novel\\nmechanomyographic (MMG) sensors to be able to monitor muscle activity during\\nstimulation in real time. To provide a meaningful task we built an FES cycling\\nrig with a software interface that enabled us to perform adaptive recording and\\nstimulation, and then combine this with sensors to record forces applied to the\\npedals using force sensitive resistors (FSRs), crank angle position using a\\nmagnetic incremental encoder and inputs from the user using switches and a\\npotentiometer.

              "36   A continuous framework for fairness   Increasingly, discrimination by algorithms is perceived as a societal and\\nlegal problem. As a response, a number of criteria for implementing algorithmic\\nfairness in machine learning have been developed in the literature. This paper\\nproposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA$\\\\theta$) which enables a\\ncontinuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More\\nspecifically, we make three main contributions to the existing literature.\\nFirst, our approach allows the decision maker to continuously vary between\\nconcepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence, the algorithm\\nenables the decision maker to adopt intermediate \"worldviews\" on the degree of\\ndiscrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to the extreme\\ncases of \"we're all equal\" (WAE) and \"what you see is what you get\" (WYSIWYG)\\nproposed so far in the literature. Second, we use optimal transport theory, and\\nspecifically the concept of the barycenter, to maximize decision maker utility\\nunder the chosen fairness constraints. Third, the algorithm is able to handle\\ncases of intersectionality, i.e., of multi-dimensional discrimination of\\ncertain groups on grounds of several criteria. We discuss three main examples\\n(college admissions; credit application; insurance contracts) and map out the\\npolicy implications of our approach. The explicit formalization of the\\ntrade-off between individual and group fairness allows this post-processing\\napproach to be tailored to different situational contexts in which one or the\\nother fairness criterion may take precedence.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
              "45   Coupling geometry on binary bipartite networks: hypotheses testing on pattern geometry and nestedness   Upon a matrix representation of a binary bipartite network, via the\\npermutation invariance, a coupling geometry is computed to approximate the\\nminimum energy macrostate of a network's system. Such a macrostate is supposed\\nto constitute the intrinsic structures of the system, so that the coupling\\ngeometry should be taken as information contents, or even the nonparametric\\nminimum sufficient statistics of the network data. Then pertinent null and\\nalternative hypotheses, such as nestedness, are to be formulated according to\\nthe macrostate. That is, any efficient testing statistic needs to be a function\\nof this coupling geometry. These conceptual architectures and mechanisms are by\\nand large still missing in community ecology literature, and rendered\\nmisconceptions prevalent in this research area. Here the algorithmically\\ncomputed coupling geometry is shown consisting of deterministic multiscale\\nblock patterns, which are framed by two marginal ultrametric trees on row and\\ncolumn axes, and stochastic uniform randomness within each block found on the\\nfinest scale. Functionally a series of increasingly larger ensembles of matrix\\nmimicries is derived by conforming to the multiscale block configurations. Here\\nmatrix mimicking is meant to be subject to constraints of row and column sums\\nsequences. Based on such a series of ensembles, a profile of distributions\\nbecomes a natural device for checking the validity of testing statistics or\\nstructural indexes. An energy based index is used for testing whether network\\ndata indeed contains structural geometry. A new version block-based nestedness\\nindex is also proposed. Its validity is checked and compared with the existing\\nones. A computing paradigm, called Data Mechanics, and its application on one\\nreal data network are illustrated throughout the developments and discussions\\nin this paper.\\n\n",

More precisely, a server implements a scheduling discipline\\nwhich belongs to the class of limited processor sharing (LPS-$d$) scheduling\\ndisciplines. Under LPS-$d$, up to $d$ jobs can be served simultaneously, and\\nhence, includes as special cases First Come First Served ($d=1$) and Processor\\nSharing ($d=\\\\infty$).\\nIn order to obtain efficient heuristics, we model the above load-balancing\\nframework as a multi-armed restless bandit problem.

In this formulation, the attacker has\\naccess to a noisy observation of the group membership of each user in the\\nsocial network.

In\\naddition, the autoencoder can be used to detect non-cellular features related\\nto sample preparation and data collection, such as carbon edges from the grid\\nand tomogram boundaries. The autoencoder is also able to detect patterns that\\nmay indicate spatial interactions between cellular components. Furthermore, we\\ndemonstrate that our autoencoder can be used for weakly supervised semantic\\nsegmentation of cellular components, requiring a very small amount of manual\\nannotation.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

              "62   Risk Estimators for Choosing Regularization Parameters in Ill-Posed Problems - Properties and Limitations   This paper discusses the properties of certain risk estimators recently\\nproposed to choose regularization parameters in ill-posed problems. A simple\\napproach is Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE), which estimates the risk in\\nthe data space, while a recent modification (GSURE) estimates the risk in the\\nspace of the unknown variable. It seems intuitive that the latter is more\\nappropriate for ill-posed problems, since the properties in the data space do\\nnot tell much about the quality of the reconstruction. We provide theoretical\\nstudies of both estimators for linear Tikhonov regularization in a finite\\ndimensional setting and estimate the quality of the risk estimators, which also\\nleads to asymptotic convergence results as the dimension of the problem tends\\nto infinity. Unlike previous papers, who studied image processing problems with\\na very low degree of ill-posedness, we are interested in the behavior of the\\nrisk estimators for increasing ill-posedness. Interestingly, our theoretical\\nresults indicate that the quality of the GSURE risk can deteriorate\\nasymptotically for ill-posed problems, which is confirmed by a detailed\\nnumerical study. The latter shows that in many cases the GSURE estimator leads\\nto extremely small regularization parameters, which obviously cannot stabilize\\nthe reconstruction. Similar but less severe issues with respect to robustness\\nalso appear for the SURE estimator, which in comparison to the rather\\nconservative discrepancy principle leads to the conclusion that regularization\\nparameter choice based on unbiased risk estimation is not a reliable procedure\\nfor ill-posed problems. A similar numerical study for sparsity regularization\\ndemonstrates that the same issue appears in nonlinear variational\\nregularization approaches.\\n                                                                          \n",

However, the test suites in practice are often too weak to\\nguarantee correctness and existing approaches often generate a large number of\\nincorrect patches.\\nTo reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, we propose a novel\\napproach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated\\npatches. The core idea is to exploit the behavior similarity of test case\\nexecutions. The passing tests on original and patched programs are likely to\\nbehave similarly while the failing tests on original and patched programs are\\nlikely to behave differently. Also, if two tests exhibit similar runtime\\nbehavior, the two tests are likely to have the same test results. Based on\\nthese observations, we generate new test inputs to enhance the test suites and\\nuse their behavior similarity to determine patch correctness.\\nOur approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 139 patches generated\\nfrom existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, jKali, ACS and\\nHDRepair. Our approach successfully prevented 56.3\\\\% of the incorrect patches\\nto be generated, without blocking any correct patches.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

              "8962 Anonymity Properties of the Bitcoin P2P Network   Bitcoin is a popular alternative to fiat money, widely used for its perceived\\nanonymity properties. However, recent attacks on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P)\\nnetwork demonstrated that its gossip-based flooding protocols, which are used\\nto ensure global network consistency, may enable user deanonymization---the\\nlinkage of a user's IP address with her pseudonym in the Bitcoin network. In\\n2015, the Bitcoin community responded to these attacks by changing the\\nnetwork's flooding mechanism to a different protocol, known as diffusion.\\nHowever, no systematic justification was provided for the change, and it is\\nunclear if diffusion actually improves the system's anonymity. In this paper,\\nwe model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties,\\nboth pre- and post-2015. In doing so, we consider new adversarial models and\\nspreading mechanisms that have not been previously studied in the\\nsource-finding literature. We theoretically prove that Bitcoin's networking\\nprotocols (both pre- and post-2015) offer poor anonymity properties on networks\\nwith a regular-tree topology. We validate this claim in simulation on a 2015\\nsnapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

If one adopts linear coupling in the\\nchain and piecewise linear on-site force, then it is possible to develop\\nwell-known exact solutions for the front and accompanying oscillatory tail. We\\ndemonstrate that these solutions are essentially non-robust. Various\\napproximations for the on-site potential with the same basic parameters (height\\nand coordinate of the potential barrier, energy effect and distance between the\\npotential wells) lead to substantially different front velocities. Besides,\\ninclusion of even weak nearest neighbor nonlinearity drastically modifies the\\nfront structure and parameters. The energy concentration in the front zone\\nleads to a dominance of the nonlinear term. It turns out that the dynamics can\\nbe efficiently studied in terms of an equivalent model with a single degree of\\nfreedom. This estimation leads to accurate prediction of the front velocity and\\nparameters of the oscillatory tail. Moreover, it turns out that the solution is\\nrobust - exact shape of the on-site potential weakly effects the front\\nparameters. This finding also conforms to the simplified model, since the\\nlatter invokes only the general shape characteristics of the on-site potential.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

              "8967 What Stays in Mind? - Retention Rates in Programming MOOCs   This work presents insights about the long-term effects and retention rates\\nof knowledge acquired within MOOCs. In 2015 and 2017, we conducted two\\nintroductory MOOCs on object-oriented programming in Java with each over 10,000\\nregistered participants. In this paper, we analyze course scores, quiz results\\nand self-stated skill levels of our participants. The aim of our analysis is to\\nuncover factors influencing the retention of acquired knowledge, such as time\\npassed or knowledge application, in order to improve long-term success. While\\nwe know that some participants learned the programming basics within our\\ncourse, we lack information on whether this knowledge was applied and fortified\\nafter the course's end. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a survey in\\n2018 among all participants of our 2015 and 2017 programming MOOCs. The first\\npart of the survey elicits responses on whether and how MOOC knowledge was\\napplied and gives participants opportunity to voice individual feedback. The\\nsecond part of the survey contains several questions of increasing difficulty\\nand complexity regarding course content in order to learn about the\\nconsolidation of the acquired knowledge. We distinguish three programming\\nknowledge areas in the survey: First, understanding of concepts, such as loops\\nand boolean algebra.

Another factor of complexity, whereby the computation\\nis allowed to take place in a precision different from the storage precisions\\nof either A or B, is also included in the discussion. We first break the\\nproblem into mostly orthogonal dimensions, considering the mixing of domains\\nseparately from mixing precisions. Support for all combinations of matrix\\noperands stored in either the real or complex domain is mapped out by\\nenumerating the cases and describing an implementation approach for each.\\nSupporting all combinations of storage and computation precisions is handled by\\ntypecasting the matrices at key stages of the computation---during packing\\nand/or accumulation, as needed. Several optional optimizations are also\\ndocumented.

              "8988 Quantifying the causal effect of speed cameras on road traffic accidents via an approximate Bayesian doubly robust estimator   This paper quantifies the effect of speed cameras on road traffic collisions\\nusing an approximate Bayesian doubly-robust (DR) causal inference estimation\\nmethod. Previous empirical work on this topic, which shows a diverse range of\\nestimated effects, is based largely on outcome regression (OR) models using the\\nEmpirical Bayes approach or on simple before and after comparisons. Issues of\\ncausality and confounding have received little formal attention. A causal DR\\napproach combines propensity score (PS) and OR models to give an average\\ntreatment effect (ATE) estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal\\nunder correct specification of either of the two component models. We develop\\nthis approach within a novel approximate Bayesian framework to derive posterior\\npredictive distributions for the ATE of speed cameras on road traffic\\ncollisions. Our results for England indicate significant reductions in the\\nnumber of collisions at speed cameras sites (mean ATE = -30%). Our proposed\\nmethod offers a promising approach for evaluation of transport safety\\ninterventions.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
